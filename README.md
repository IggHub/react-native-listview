# React-Native ListView Demo (Expo)

Original tutorial: Spencer Carli's [medium page](https://medium.com/differential/react-native-basics-how-to-use-the-listview-component-a0ec44cf1fe8)

Done using `create-react-native-app`. Viewable via [expo](https://expo.io).

# How to use this repo:

1. Install React-Native. I would highly recommend downloading  [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).
2. Install [Expo](https://expo.io/tools)
3. Clone Repo
4. Launch Expo.
5. Project -> Open Project -> (folder where the project is) -> Device -> Open IOS Simulator (alternatively, you can also use Expo's QR)

Alternatively, you can also follow the medium article and build it from scratch! Refer to this repo when you get stuck (assuming you are using `create-react-native-app` to start)
